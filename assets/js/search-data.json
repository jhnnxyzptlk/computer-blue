            "content": "My adventure towards technology began roughly two years ago with Lambda School. I had no desire to return to a typical university for a bachelor&#39;s degree. I also lacked both time and funds. As a result, Lambda School sounded like a wise investment. I was mistaken. Now, I won&#39;t go into too much detail regarding Lambda School, but at the end of the program, I felt as though I still lacked something. Or perhaps the motivation for the type of computational skills I was seeking was misaligned. . So I spent a few months exploring as best I could on my computer screen (because of covid lockdowns). I discovered a plethora of exciting courses, I attended interesting online conferences, and listened to an unknown number of podcasts. One particular Course hosted by Professor Onur Mutlu caught my attention. The concept of learning about computer architecture from electrons to the problem you&#39;re attempting to solve is maybe the best expression of what I&#39;m attempting to achieve: to do great work using the art of science and engineering for the betterment of humanity. . Returning to the something that was lacking from Lambda School. Today, information is abundant, but wisdom is exceedingly rare. While Lambda School teaches the tools well, they lack the soul, or the art of the craft. They overlooked the nuances that enable Machine Learning to perform so well now. And that necessitates a great deal of mathematics, not less. We are facing a highly technical future in which CPU chips will be ubiquitous. In order to do outstanding work in tackling humanity&#39;s most pressing concerns, we will require specialist engineers who understand the entire stack, from electrons to the problem you&#39;re trying to solve. . For now, I&#39;m mostly concentrating on completing Professor Onur Mutlu two excellent courses: Digital Design and Computer Architecture to start, and his more specialized Computer Architecture course, which covers the more cutting edge research in the field. You can check out more lecture videos here. . Enjoy the rest of your summer. Covid-19 left me extremely drained emotionally and mentally. Thats why I decided on a sabbatical. I will return September 21, 2021, and finish the rest of the year strong. .",

            "content": "PROJECT ON HOLD . The Serendipitous Discovery of the Fractal Integer Arithmetic. . In mid-1978 a professional artist colleague, Professor John Biggers of the Texas Southern University School of Art presented Powell with an urgent and insistent aesthetic inquiry in connection with the qualitative embodiment of the quantitative relationship that Leonardo da Vinci had referred to as the Divine Proportion. Biggers desired to discover some of the special gestalt which this relation endowed in the canonical works of ancient Artists and Architects, as admired by da Vinci. . The inquiry led to a several week duration study, in Biggers’ Art School, of the geometry rules which seemed to govern and to guide the composers of the ancient compositions in Art and Architecture. The several week long study enabled Biggers to establish a new and profound personal and professional connection with the canon of geometry rules which seemed to guide and govern the ancient composers’ works of Art and Architecture. The code so admired by da Vinci was recognized to be merely the most elegant of a hierarchy of only three codes which governed and guided the holistic integrity of all the canonical works of ancient Sacred Geometry (1) . A meta-mathematical study and synthesis of the three codes, by Powell, led to the recognition that the three codes formed the hierarchy of expression of an ancient Theorem of Euclid, a Theorem of Euclidean Geometry which calibrates the entire Euclidean plane , in sets of Cartesian coordinates; the hierarchy of coordinates calibrates the plane, with positional notation, in terms of (±) powers of the three fractal number integer vectors : $ sqrt{2}$, $ sqrt{3}$, $1/2 ( sqrt{5} + sqrt{1})$ .

SOME IMPLICATIONS OF ‘ THE REST OF ‘EUCLID’ . as PARADIGM FOR a THIRD MILLENNIUM POLITICS OF ECOLOGY . FOREWORD . WE ARE a physicist, an architect, and a visual artist – a trans-disciplinary team of non-mathematician intellectuals. Our connection is a complementary set of professional interests in the study of a trans-intellectual question: by what methods were the ancient guilds of architects and artists so able to embody into their works the gestalt element of beauty and fitness that characterizes their agelessly elegant compositions? | A quite adequate capture of the ‘flavor’ of the elusive aesthetic property we study can be inferred from our paraphrase of a set of remarks by Professor Dan Pedoe – himself a careful student of the guilds. Early in his pleasure– encouraging book, GEOMETRY and the VISUAL ARTS, Pedoe gives a review of : the appropriate breadth and depth of concern with the whole subject of architecture, as recommended by Marcus Vitruvius – himself one of the significant links in our unbroken chain of inherited guildsmen.(1) Our paraphrase: . The elegant construction depends on order, arrangement, eurhythmy, propriety, symmetry, and economy. …. Order gives due measure to the members of a work considered separately. Symmetry gives agreement to the proportions of the whole. It is an adjustment in according to quantity. By this is meant the selection of modules from the members of the work itself, and constructing the whole work to correspond. Eurhythmy is beauty and fitness in the adjustment of the members of a work. . [… and… ] . Symmetry is a proper agreement between the members of the work itself, and the relation between the different parts of the whole general scheme, in accordance with a certain part selected as the standard. . Any search for the technical methods by which these ineffable aesthetic embodiments into visual structures are accomplished must lead an interest such as ours to a study of the guilds’ strategic employment of their three essential instruments for producing geometric constructions in the plane: . the compass; . the straight edge; . and [!!!] . an un-marked plane surface, of some sort. . Our experimental studies of the ancients’ works, using the three essential tools, compelled us to consider, as a working proposition, that the guildsmen were governed rigorously by a protocol of rules which nevertheless permitted, perhaps indeed guaranteed the consequent embodiment of the ineffable qualities captured in the Vitruvius precis. His remark, “ …. in accordance with a certain part selected as the standard”, was particularly compelling as an organizing clue to guide our experimental strategies at de-constructing (2), and re-constructing, the Implicate Order plane geometry patterns which seemed to govern the general scheme of the evolution of a work. . Indeed, this snippet from Vitruvius was found to explain precisely the key to the success of our program of gestalt pattern analysis and synthesis: in over a couple of decades of playful study we slowly learned that the ancients merely required that their works be Theorems of plane , and 3-dimensional, Geometry !! . euclid 6 -3- . That is to say, the Implicate Order pattern by which the guilds assured the gestalt coherence of the whole general scheme was an Implicate Order palimpsest determined strictly by the Five ‘Rules of Euclid’ which govern and assure the construction of a Theorem. We recognized that this system of rules is the complete set of Canons that governed and guided their choices of composition strategies and tactics for relating between the different parts of the whole general scheme, in accordance with a certain part selected as a reference. We recognized that centuries of canonical constructions – say, from ancientEgypt’sTemple ofKarnak toNew York City’s Cathedral of Saint John the Devine – give enduring record of the guilds’ adherence to the perennial accumulation of a syllabus of strategic, canonical, gestalt-embodying palimpsests, governed by this protocol. . This SET OF (FIVE) RULES comprises three of the five ‘Postulates of Euclid’, which together with the five “Axioms of Euclid’, provide the platform for Euclid’s masterpiece, The Elements. One of those unique books like the Bible which seem to fuse the best efforts of generations of creative minds into a single inspired, creative whole, The Elements is a work of such commanding lucidity and style that some scholars consder it the most coherent collection of closely reasoned thoughts ever set down by man (3) | The Elements contains 13 books, or chapters, which describe and prove a good part of all that the human race knows, even now, about lines, points, circles and the elementary three-dimensional shapes. (3) . Our program of analysis and synthesis of the ancient palimpsest structures has permitted the recognition of a related pair of Theorems which is the foundation for the construction of all possible Implicate Order patterns embodying the gestalt eurhythmy, symmetry, and economy. This inter-articulated pair of theorems extends, qualitatively and quantitatively, what the human race knows about lines, points, circles and the elementary three-dimensional shapes. Our extension of this knowledge, our ancient pair of theorems, emerges as implications embodied in the teachings of very first Problem of the very first Book of The Elements. | To our great surprise, the pair of theorems also provides – permits the definition of- a remarkable generalization of the foundation of the architecture of the structure of our modern 20th century mathematics. . The revolutionary generalization also, of course, evolutioinizes applied mathematics as a 3rd millennium scientific instrument. . We refer to this ancient pair of implications of Proposition 1, Book I – ignored, neglected, over looked for two millennia now – as THE REST OF EUCLID. . The purpose of our book, then, is two-fold: (1) to present this serendipitous discovery of a revolutionary generalization of the elementary mathematical concept, Number, and its co-related evolutionary mathematical architecture, an ab inito non-linear Arithmetic; and (2) a cursory sketch of the evolutionary applied mathematics instrumentations co-related to the richer Arithmetic. . | For cultural reasons, the professional mathematician must, as a conditioned reflex, play Devil’s Advocate to the claim of discovery, by a trio of non-mathematician amateurs, of such a humongous un-tapped epistemological universe for the Western Europe intellect as (1) our THE REST OF EUCLID and (2) its co-related evolutionary applied mathematics enablements. Surely the ‘West’-dominated guild of mathematicians has already fully exhausted the Teachings of The Elements as a rational source of what is possible to know. . | euclid 6 -4- . Therefore, so as not to be dismissed peremptorily by the likes of Ian Stewart and John Casti as a ‘Math Crank’ (4), our book’s presentation has tried to adhere to that profession’s arcane ( and in key places, now obsolescent) vocabulary, grammar and rhetoric. Nevertheless we intend the interested non-mathematician reader to be able to grok the simple revolutionary and evolutionary features of the generalizations. Hence the presentation seeks also to subvert the conditioned reflex aversion-to-mathematics of the non-mathematician reader. . (1) Pedoe, Dan.

            "title": "Python",
            "content": "Overview . This is not a thorough Python tutorial; rather, it is meant to highlight the aspects of the language that will be most useful to us. If you&#39;ve never used Python before, you should probably augment this with a beginner friendly tutorial. . The Zen of Python . import this . Whitespace . Many languages use curly braces to delimit blocks of code. Python uses indentation: . Modules . Certain features of python are not loaded by default. These inlclude both features that are included as part of the language as well as third-party features that you downloaded yourself. In order to use these features, you&#39;ll need to import the modules that contain them. . One approach is import the module itself: . import re my_regex = re.compile(&quot;[0-9]+&quot;, re.I) . Here, re is the module containing functions and contants for working with regular expression. After this type of import you must prefix those functions with re, in order to access them. . If you already had a different re in your code, you could use an alias: . import re as regex my_regex = regex.compile(&quot;[0-9]+&quot;, regex.I) . You might also use an alias if your module has an unwieldy name or if you&#39;re going to be typing it a lot. For example, a standard convention when visualizing data with matplotlib is: . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot(...) . If you need a few specific values from a module, you can import them explicitly and use them without qualification: . from collections import defaultdict, Counter lookup = defaultdict(int) my_counter = Counter() . Functions . A function is a rule for taking zero or more inputs and returning a corresponding output. In Python, we typically define functions using def: . def double(x): &quot;&quot;&quot; This is wehere you put optional docstring that explains what the function does. For examples, this function multiplies its input by 2. &quot;&quot;&quot; return x * 2 . Python functions are first-class, which means that we can assign them to variables and pass them into functions just like any other arguments: . def apply_to_one(f): &quot;&quot;&quot;Calls the funtion f with 1 as its argument&quot;&quot;&quot; return f(1) my_double = double # references the previously defined function. x = apply_to_one(my_double) # equals 2 print(x) . We can also create short anomynous functions called lambda functions. . y = apply_to_one(lambda x: x + 4) #equals 5 print(y) . Function parameters can also be given default arguments, which only need to be specified when you want a value other than the default: . def my_print(message = &#39;a default message&#39;): print(message) my_print(&quot;hello&quot;) # prints &#39;hello&#39; my_print() # prints &#39;a default message&#39; . Often its sometimes useful to specify arguments by name: . def full_name(first = &quot;Whats-his-face&quot;, last = &quot;Something&quot;): return first + &quot; &quot; + last full_name(&quot;Johann&quot;, &quot;Augustine&quot;) full_name(&quot;Johann&quot;) full_name(last=&quot;augustine&quot;) . Strings . Strings can be delimited by single or double quotation marks: . single_quoted = &#39;data science&#39; double_quoted = &quot;data science&quot; . python uses backslashes to encode special characters: . tab_string = &quot; t&quot; # represents the tab characters len(tab_string) . But if you want backlashes, you can create raw strings usingr&quot;&quot;: . not_tab_string = r&quot; t&quot; # represents the characters &#39;t&#39; and &#39;t&#39; len(not_tab_string) . We can create multiline strings using three quotes: . multiline_string = &quot;&quot;&quot;first line. second line and third line&quot;&quot;&quot; . Since Python 3.6 we are able to use a neat feature called f-string. This provides a simple way to substitute values into strings. . first_name = &quot;Johann&quot; last_name = &quot;Augustine&quot; full_name = f&quot;{first_name} {last_name}&quot; print(full_name) . Exceptions . When something goes wrong, Python raises an exception. Unhandled, exceptions will cause your program to crash. We can handle them using try and except: . try: print(0 / 0) except ZeroDivisionError: print(&quot;cannot divide by zero&quot;) . Lists . One of the most fundamental data structure in Python is the list. A list is simply an ordered collection of objects. In other languages it might be called an array. . int_list = [1, 2, 3] hetero_list = [&quot;string&quot;, 0.1, True] list_of_lists = [int_list, hetero_list, []] . We can get the nth element of a list with square brackets: . x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] zero = x[0] # zero indexed, 0 one = x[1] # 1 nine = x[-1] # last element, 9 eight = x[-2] # second to last element, 8 x[0] = -1 # zero index is now equal to -1 . We can slice a list as well. The slice i:j means all elements from i (inclusive) to j (not inclusive). . first_three = x[:3] # [-1, 1, 2] three_to_end = x[3:] # [3, 4, ..., 9] one_to_four = x[1:5] # [1, 2, 3, 4] last_three = x[-3:] # [7, 8, 9] wo_fist_last = x[1:-1] # [1, 2, ..., 8] . print(wo_fist_last) . Not only can we slice strings but other sequential types as well. . A slice can take a third argument to indicate its stride. . every_third = x[::3] # [-1, 3, 6, 9] five_to_three = x[5:2:-1] # [5, 4, 3] . print(five_to_three) . Python has an in operator that checks for list membership: . 1 in [1, 2, 3] . 0 in [1, 2, 3] . We can concatenate list together. If you want to modify a list in place, you can use extend to add items from another collection: . x = [1, 2, 3] x.extend([4, 5, 6]) # x is now [1, 2, ..., 6] . We can also use &#39;addition&#39;: . x = [1, 2, 3] y = x + [4, 5, 6] # y is now “[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; x is unchanged” . We can append a list one item at a time: . x = [1, 2, 3] x.append(0) # x is not [1, 2, 3, 0] y = x[-1] # 0 z = len(x) # 4 . We can unpack lists: . x, y = [1, 2] # x is 1, and y is 2 . And lastly we can use an underscore for a value you&#39;re going to throw away: . _, y = [1, 2] # y == 2 . Tuples . Tuples are list immutable cousins. Anything your can do to a list that doest involve modifying it can be done to a tuple. We specify tuples by using parentheses or nothing instead of using brackets: . a_list = [1, 2] a_tuple = (1, 2) b_tuple = 3, 4 . a_tuple[1] = 3 . Tuples are a convenient way to return multuple values from functions: . def sum_product(x, y): return (x + y), (x * y) sp = sum_product(2, 3) s, p = sum_product(5, 10) . sp . s . p . Like lists, tuples can be used for multiple assignment: . x, y = 1, 2 x, y = y, x . Dictionaries . Another fundament data structure is a dictionary, which associates values with keys and allows you to quickly retrieve the value corresponding to a given key: . empty_dict = {} grades = {&quot;Johann&quot;: 42, &quot;someone&quot;: 300} #dictionary literal . To look up the value for a key, we use square brackets: . Johann = grades[&quot;Johann&quot;] print(Johann) . But you&#39;ll get a KeyError if you ask for a key thats not in the dictionary: . try: kate = grades[&quot;Kate&quot;] except KeyError: print(&#39;no grade for kate!&#39;) . We can check for the existense of a key using in: . johann_grade = &quot;Johann&quot; in grades johann_grade . kate_grade = &quot;Kate&quot; in grades kate_grade . johann_grade = grades.get(&quot;Johann&quot;, 0) kate_grade = grades.get(&quot;Kate&quot;, 0) . kate_grade . defaultdict . Imagine that you&#39;re trying to count the words in a document. An obvious approach is to create a dictionary in which the keys are words and the values are counts. As you check each word, you can increment its count if its already in the dictionary and add if to the dictionary if its not: . word_counts = {} for word in document: if word in word_counts: word_counts[word] += 1 else: word_counts[word] = 1 . We can use try and except to handle the exception of trying to look up a mising key: . word_counts = {} for word in document: try: word_counts[word] += 1 except KeyError: word_counts[word] = 1 . And a third approach is to use get, which behaves gracefully for missing keys: . word_counts = {} for word in document: prev_count = word_counts.get(word, 0) word_counts[word] = prev_count + 1 . Every one of these is slighly unwieldy, which is why defaultdict is useful. A defaultdict is like a regular dictionary, except that when you try to look up a key it doesnt contain, it first adds a value for it using a zero-argument function you provided when creating it. . from collections import defaultdict word_counts = defaultdict(int) for word in document: word_counts[word] += 1 . dd_list = defaultdict(list) # list() produces and empty list. dd_list[2].append(1) dd_dict = defaultdict(dict) # dict() produces an empty dict dd_dict[&quot;Johann&quot;][&quot;City&quot;] = &quot;NYC&quot; . dd_list . dd_dict . These will be useful when we&#39;re using dictionaries to &quot;collect&quot; results by some key and dont want to have to check every time to see if they key exist yet. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

            "title": "Representing Numbers",
            "content": "Overview . In our day to day lives we humans use at least two distinct number systems: The Decimal system, Base 10, and base 60, to measure time. Computers on the other hand use binary, base 2, number system to represent continous quantities with discrete approximations. When dealing with any kind of digital electronics that uses numbers, it&#39;s critical to consider the various ways in which numbers are expressed in these systems. . BASE-N AND BINARY . The decimal system is a number representation system that you learned in grade school. An integer in the decimal system is measured by a sequence of digits ranging from 0 to 9, with each digit representing the coefficient for a power of ten. . $11 = 1*10^1 + 1*10^0$ . Numbers, or any type of data, are interpreted by computers as base-2 or binary numbers. The only digits used in binary are 0 and 1, and each digit is the coefficient of a power of two. The digits in a binary number are often referred to as bits. It&#39;s important to remember that binary numbers are still numbers, and the processes for adding and multiplying them are the same as you learned in elementary school. . $11 = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 1011_2$ . In contrast to humans, who can abstract numbers to arbitrarily large values, computers have a set number of bits that they can store at one time. A 32-bit machine, for example, can only display and process 32-digit binary numbers. . Representing fractional parts of numbers this way, however, is not nearly as well-behaved as representing integers. For instance, writing the fraction $1/3$ in binary requires infinitely many digits:$0.010101...$ . Note: 0.99999…. does not, and will never equal to 1. Stop embarrassing yourself. . Representing Real Numbers . For any given device, the number of bits is normally fixed. We can&#39;t do important engineering calculations with binary representation because the range and precision of numbers are inadequate. We use floating point numbers, or floats for short, to achieve the required range of values for the same number of bits. By far the most common format for storing floating-point numbers is provided by the IEEE 754 standard. . How does this work in Python . We&#39;ll start with something simple like The Integers. . Python has two internal representations for numbers. The conversion between these two is automatic and seamless. Python will typically employ 4-byte or 8-byte integer values for tiny numbers. The details are buried in the internals of CPython. . Lets say we want to know how many ways to permute a standard deck of 52 cards. To compute such a large number we will use the factorial function from the math module. . import math math.factorial(52) . 80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000 . Thats a big numbuner. We are blessed that we do not have to deal with the internals of declairing our integers like in C. You dont notice the switch when you compute this but python used small integers to calculate the the first 10 factorials or so. After that, it had to switch to larger integers. . We can look at the details on the internals of integers like so: . import sys math.log(sys.maxsize, 2) . 63.0 . sys.int_info . sys.int_info(bits_per_digit=30, sizeof_digit=4) . What we see here is the sys.maxsize value the largest of the small integer values. We computed the log to base-2 to find out how many bits are required for this number. Which is a 63-bit value. . The values in sys.int_info tell us that the large integers are a sequence of 30-bit digits, and each of these digits occupies 4 bytes. . So a large number like $52!$ consists of 8 of these 30-bit size digits. Instead of the commonly used symbols for base-10 numbers, we need $2^{30}$ distinct symbols for each digit of these large numbers. . Floating-point Approximations: . Now in order to deal with real numbers on a computer we need to approximate. Computers only have a certain number of bits that makes dealing with real numbers problamatic. . https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html . 0.1 + 0.2 . 0.30000000000000004 . 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 . False .",

            "content": "Overview . The method of calculating the value of the derivative of an explicitly undefined function with a given discrete set of points is known as numerical differentiation. . One means of finding the derivative is to approximate the function locally by a polynomial and the to differentiate it. . And equally effective tool is the taylor series expansion of a function about a point. . To numerically distinguish a function, we first compute an interpolating polynomial and then compute the approximate derivative at the specified point. . Note: It is assumed that you already know about derivatives from an elementary calculus course. . The Derivative . Recall that the derivative $f&#39;(x)$ of a function $f(x)$ at a point x is defined by the diffence quotient, where the limit of $ delta x$ tend to zero. . $$f&#39;(x) = lim_{ delta x to 0} frac{f(x + delta x) - f(x)}{ delta x}$$ . In other words, the difference quotient is an approximation of the derivative $f&#39;(x)$, and this approximation gets better as $ delta x$ gets smaller. . Numerical Differentiation . Numerical differention of function becomes important for at least two reasons: If a function exist as tabulated values at discrete points along the abscissa, such as data from some kind of measurement, then the function can only be computed numerically. Application of numerical differention for solving differential equations. . Because a computer cannot actually take the limit as the size of the region, ℎ h , shrinks all the way to zero, an approximate derivative instead is computed from the same expression without taking the limit, .

            "title": "Calculus, A quick Review",
            "content": "Overview . All of the mathematics up until calculus, which includes algebra and geometry, largely focuses on static problems, that is, problems devoid of change. Calculus is the first subject one undertakes in solving dynamic problems. . Calculus is sometimes known as infinitesimal calculus in its early days, is a mathematical subject that focuses on: . functions | limits | continuity | derivatives | integrals | . We use two central ideas when dealing with calculus, differential calculus and integral calculus. The former is concerned with instantaneous rates of change and curve slopes, whereas integral calculus is concerned with quantity accumulation and areas under or between curves. . Differential calculus can be thought of as a process of infinitely fine subtraction that is used to measure the differences between its parts. . Integral Calculus can be thought of as the process of infinitely fine additions, which integrates the parts back into the original whole. . Here I will do my best to lay out the high level ideas of Calculus. Hope you enjoy. . Functions . In calculus, we study quantities that change. Quantities that change are called variables. . Temperature, for example, is a variable that changes throughout the day. Another example is the speed at which you drive your car. This is why calculus can be both interesting and practical. It can be applied to any changing variable. . We perceive not only changing quantities in nature, but we can also notice that some quantities are related in some way. . Suppose the value of a variable quantity $y$ depends solely on the value of another variable quantity $x$. This relationship is called a function if for each input $x$ there is exactly one output $y$. . In a more formal way write $y = f(x)$, and say that y is a function of x. We call $f$ the function, $x$ the independent variable, and $y$ the dependent variable. . More ways to describe a function: . The x-value is called an input, and the y-value an output. | The set of all inputs is called the domain of $f$ ; the set of all outputs is called the range of $f$. | . Now theres a whole zoo of functions that will take you a lifetime to explore. We won&#39;t be going over them here. But here is a nice place to start. . Limits and Continuity . What does it mean to be continous . Our experience in our daily lives appears to be continuous. That is, there are no abrupt changes or discontinuities in what we perceive and experience. That&#39;s great news. Imagine you&#39;re out for a beautiful walk when all of a sudden a split second disappears from the cosmos. That would be disastrous and unexpected for our experience. . Note:No change in nature can ever take place “by a leap&quot;. Does continuity imply infinity? Well if we imagine a number line we assume there is an infinite number of numbers. That is there is a number in every posible position on the number line, its therefore smooth and continous. Yet within the infinite there seems to be discrete amount of numbers, such as the integers. What gives? . Note: I will write more on the Principal of Continuity in a future blog post. A rigorous definition of continuity of real functions is usually given in a first course in calculus in terms of the idea of a limit. In mathematics, many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the page. Such functions are called continuous. . Not all functions are continuous. Sometimes we cant figure out what a function is doing directly at a point. We can however see what it should be as we get closer to a limiting value. . For example, $f(x) = frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ where, $f(1)$ is not defined . $f(0.9)$ $f(0.99)$ $f(0.999)$ $f(1.0)$ $f(1.001)$ $f(1.01)$ $f(1.1)$ . $1.900$ | $1.990$ | $1.999$ | $undefined$ | $2.001$ | $2.010$ | $2.100$ | . Derivatives . what is a derivative? . The derivivative of a function measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value)1. . What does this all mean? How can we vizualize this? . We may approach this question from multiple perspectives. . Geometric Interpretation of Differentiation . From a geometric point of view the derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$. But what is a tangent line, exactly? . It is the limit of the secant line (a line drawn between two points on the graph) as the distance between the two points goes to zero. . You take the Point Q and you move it closer to P. In a more formal way but not rigorous, it is the limit of the slope of the secant line PQ as Q → P (where P fixed). The slope of PQ is represented by this graph: . . As $Q$ approaches $P$ – i.e., as $x$ approaches $0$ from both sides – this quantity becomes the instantaneous rate of change at $P$, defined by: . $$ lim_{ Delta x to 0} frac{ Delta f}{ Delta x} = lim_{ Delta x to 0} frac{f(x + Delta x) - f(x)}{ Delta x} = f&#39;(x)$$ . Tip: This is called the difference quotient . Physical Interpretation of Differentiation . One interpretation everyone is familar with is driving a car. You step on the pedal, the car accelerates. Your odometer tells you how fast you are going at any given moment in time. That seems kind of odd since the difference quotient implies the average of two points. Theres no trickery here, your odometer is calculating your speed with two points really really close together. . Check out The paradox of the derivative on youtube. . Basic properties and formulas . Using the definition of the derivative, it is possible to establish the following derivative formulas. . Integrals . Integration is the process of finding the antiderivative of a function. . Integration can be used to solve the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others. . tip:The Area is a visualization technique for learning . We write $ int f(x) ,dx$ to find the integral. . From a geometric point of view, the integral can be interpreted as the area under the curve of the mathematical function $f(x)$ plotted as a function of $x$. . You may imagine drawing a huge number of blocks to approximate the area under a complex curve, with more blocks yielding a better solution. The integral provides a mathematical method for drawing an unlimited number of blocks and obtaining an exact analytical expression for the area. . That&#39;s crucial for geometry, and even more so for the physical sciences, where the definitions of many physical phenomena, such as the area under a curve, can be expressed mathematically. . The area of a small block under a curve can be thought of as the width of the strip multiplied by (i.e., weighted by) the height of the strip. Many features of continuous substances are dependent on weighted sums, which must be infinite weighted sums to be correct - a challenge tailor-made for the integral. . Tip: Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions of the integral. This is a highly oversimplified overview of integrals. You can check out this video from 3b1b on integrals. . . The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus . The two branches are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus, which shows how the definite integral is calculated by using its antiderivative (a function whose rate of change, or derivative, equals the function being integrated). . 1. Wikipedia-Derivative link!↩ . . Tip: History of Calculus Calculus, like any subject matter deserves special treatment and care when starting. Here are my favorite textbooks when I was learning calculus: . Calculus by Michael Spivak | MITs Single Variable Calculus | . In my opinion mathematics should be a very personal experience between the paper, pencil, Mind and God. I have too many notebooks filled with mathematical equations and ideas that I have picked up through out my years. .",

            "content": "Overview . Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the critical process of conducting preliminary investigations on data in order to discover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. . When we first start with a new dataset, we often perform exploratory data analysis. The discoveries that we make during this stage of the process drive how we treat our data, the models we choose, the approach we take to analyzing our data, and, in large part, the entirety of our data science methodology and next steps. . Load a CSV dataset using pandas read_csv . We will be working with data in many different forms throughout our careers. But before we can start to do anything with that data, we need to load it into our workspace. . Tip: Start with Google colab and ease your way into a working local environment on your machine. . Pandas . You are likely already familiar with the Python data analysis library pandas. We&#39;ll provide a quick overview here and then work through some examples in the next section. . The pandas library includes a wide range of data analysis and manipulation tools. It also offers data structures (Series, DataFrames) that are designed to function well with a variety of data types, including tabular data, time series data, and matrix data (for example, columns with different data types) using read.csv to read files . To begin, we&#39;ll look at one of the most commonly used pandas methods: read csv. This method can be used to read data in the comma separated value (csv) format: each row&#39;s values are separated by a comma, and new lines (rows) begin on the next line. A csv file can be loaded from a URL or read from a locally stored file on your device. . There are many options for using read csv, as there are for several other pandas methods. To learn more about these, start with some of the official documentation at https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/. . Load a CSV dataset from a URL using pandas read_csv . import pandas as pd # Set a variable to the URL you copied above url = &#39;https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/tic-tac-toe/tic-tac-toe.data&#39; # Read or load the data df = pd.read_csv(url) . Load a CSV dataset from a local file using pandas read_csv . When working with data sets, you&#39;ll find many of them conveniently stored on online at various locations (UCI Repository, Kaggle, etc.). But you&#39;ll often want to download a data set to store it on your local computer. This makes it easy to use tools on your computer to view and edit the file in addition to having a copy safely stored on your hard drive. . The pandas read_csv() method can also read in locally saved files. Instead of providing the URL, you will use the path to the file. Think of the path like the address of the file: it&#39;s a list of directories leading to the file location. An example path might look like /Users/myname/Documents/data_science/tic-tac-toe.data where the last part of the path is the file name. To read in a local file with pandas, you can use the following code (assume pandas has been imported): . import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/home/username/Downloads/tic-tac-toe.data&#39;) . Use basic Pandas functions for Exploratory Data Analysis-EDA . Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a very important part of learning to be a data scientist. And something that experienced data scientists do on a regular basis. We&#39;ll be using some of the numerous tools available in the pandas library. Earlier in the module, we learned how to load data sets into notebooks. So now that we have all this data, what do we do with it? . Basic Information . There are a few methods to look at your DataFrame quickly and get an idea of what&#39;s inside. Here are a few of the most common with descriptions of what each method does: . method description . df.shape | display the size (x, y) | . df.head() | display the first n rows (default=5) | . df.tail() | display the last n rows (default=5) | . df.describe() | display the statistics of numerical data types | . df.info() | display the number of entries (rows), number of columns, and the data types | . Column-specific . Sometimes we don&#39;t want to look at the entire DataFrame and instead want to focus on a single column or a few columns. There are a few ways to select a column but we&#39;ll mainly use the column name. If we have a DataFrame called df and a column named &quot;column_1&quot; we could select just a single column by using df[&quot;column_1&quot;]. Once we have a single column selected, we can use some of the following methods to get more information. . method description . df.columns | print a list of the columns | . df[&#39;column_name&#39;] | select a single column ( returns a Series) | . df[&#39;column_name&#39;].value_counts() | count the number of object and boolean occurrences | . df.sort_values(by=&#39;column_name&#39;) | sort the values in the given column | . df.drop() | remove rows or columns by specifying the label or index of the row/column | . Missing Values . There is a lot of data out there, and along with that comes the unavoidable fact that some of it will be messy. This means that there will be missing values, &quot;not-a-number&quot; (NaN) occurrences, and problems with zeros not being actually zero. Fortunately, there are a number of pandas methods that make dealing with the mess a little easier. . method description . df.isnull().sum() | count and sum the number of null occurrences (NaN or None) | . df.fillna() | fill NaN values in a variety of ways | . df.dropna() | remove values that are NaN or None; by default removes all rows with NaNs | . The above methods cover a lot of ground but we&#39;ll work through examples using them on a data set. First, we need some data. We&#39;ll use the M&amp;Ms data set for this, because it&#39;s small and contains both numeric and Object (string) data types. . url_mms = &#39;https://tinyurl.com/mms-statistics&#39; df = pd.read_csv(url_mms) # Looks at the dimensions of your data: print(df.shape) (816, 4) # Looks at first 5 rows of your data: df.head() .

We can use describe to print out the statistics for the numeric columns using df.describe(): . df.describe() . diameter mass . count 816.000000 | 816.000000 | . mean 14.171912 | 1.419632 | . std 1.220001 | 0.714765 | . min 11.230000 | 0.720000 | . 25% 13.220000 | 0.860000 | . 50% 13.600000 | 0.920000 | . 75% 15.300000 | 1.930000 | . max 17.880000 | 3.620000 | . df.columns prints the column labels of the DataFrame. . df.columns . Index([&#39;type&#39;, &#39;color&#39;, &#39;diameter&#39;, &#39;mass&#39;], dtype=&#39;object&#39;) . Say we dont need a column any more, we can drop it with df.drop . df.drop(columns=&#39;mass&#39;).head() . type color diameter . 0 peanut butter | blue | 16.20 | . 1 peanut butter | brown | 16.50 | . 2 peanut butter | orange | 15.48 | . 3 peanut butter | brown | 16.32 | . 4 peanut butter | yellow | 15.59 | . And lastly say we want to look at all the different values a certain column has. We can do so with df[&#39;column name&#39;].value_counts() . df[&#39;type&#39;].value_counts() . plain 462 peanut butter 201 peanut 153 Name: type, dtype: int64 . Fin . I don&#39;t ever remember all these techniques. So I either google what I need or head over to Python Data Science Handbook to refresh my memory. . Other major topics for EDA that I did not discuss: . Make features | Join and reshape data | Explanatory Visualizations | . . Note: This post is a reflection of my first week at Lambda School. For a more rigorous introduction to python, pandas and EDA, you can reference Python for Data Analysis .",
