    "In our day to day lives we humans use at least two distinct number systems: The Decimal system, `Base 10`, and `base 60`, to measure time. Computers on the other hand use binary, `base 2`, number system to represent continous quantities with discrete approximations. When dealing with any kind of digital electronics that uses numbers, it's critical to consider the various ways in which numbers are expressed in these systems.\n",

    "The decimal system is a number representation system that you learned in grade school. An integer in the decimal system is measured by a sequence of digits ranging from 0 to 9, with each digit representing the coefficient for a power of ten.\n",

    "Numbers, or any type of data, are interpreted by computers as `base-2` or binary numbers. The only digits used in binary are 0 and 1, and each digit is the coefficient of a power of two. The digits in a binary number are often referred to as bits. It's important to remember that binary numbers are still numbers, and the processes for adding and multiplying them are the same as you learned in elementary school.\n",

    "> $11 = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 1011_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to humans, who can abstract numbers to arbitrarily large values, computers have a set number of bits that they can store at one time. A 32-bit machine, for example, can only display and process 32-digit binary numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing fractional parts of numbers this way, however, is not nearly as well-behaved as representing integers. For instance, writing the fraction $1/3$ in binary requires infinitely many digits: $0.010101...$\n",

    "For any given device, the number of bits is normally fixed. We can't do important engineering calculations with binary representation because the range and precision of numbers are inadequate. We use floating point numbers, or floats for short, to achieve the required range of values for the same number of bits. By far the most common format for storing floating-point numbers is provided by the [IEEE 754 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).\n",
