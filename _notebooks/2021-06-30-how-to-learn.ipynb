    "Imagine having the most powerful computer on this planet and not one instruction manual in sight. The human brain is the most advanced natural technology planet Earth has produced and each computer is custom made from scratch. Not even the most advanced supercomputers can keep up with our brain. \n",

    "This course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. We’ll learn about how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”) information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life. If you’re already an expert, this peep under the mental hood will give you ideas for turbocharging successful learning, including counter-intuitive test-taking tips and insights that will help you make the best use of your time on homework and problem sets. If you’re struggling, you’ll see a structured treasure trove of practical techniques that walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If you’ve ever wanted to become better at anything, this course will help serve as your guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course can be taken independent of, concurrent with, or prior to, its companion course, Mindshift. (Learning How to Learn is more learning-focused, and Mindshift is more career-focused.)  A related course by the same instructors is Uncommon Sense Teaching."

    "Learning How to Learn is meant to help you reframe how you think about learning, to help reduce your frustration and increase the depth of your learning.\n",

    "There have been enormous strides from research in discovering how we learn most effectively. Finding a way to simply and effectively share these ideas with you has been an big undertaking, but we feel it's well worth doing—you'll see that many of these ideas, although simple, are incredibly powerful."
