    "[Digital Design and Computer Architecture](https://safari.ethz.ch/digitaltechnik/spring2021/doku.php?id=start) and a more detailed [Computer Architecture ](https://safari.ethz.ch/architecture_seminar/spring2021/doku.php?id=schedule). \n",

    "The class provides a first introduction to the design of digital circuits and computer architecture. It covers technical foundations of how a computing platform is designed from the bottom up. It introduces various execution paradigms, hardware description languages, and principles in digital design and computer architecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "This class provides a first approach to Computer Architecture. The students learn the design of digital circuits in order to:\n",
    "- understand the basics, \n",
    "- understand the principles (of design), \n",
    "- understand the precedents (in computer architecture). \n",
    "Based on such understanding, the students are expected to:\n",
    "- learn how a modern computer works underneath, from the bottom up, \n",
    "- evaluate tradeoffs of different designs and ideas, \n",
    "- implement a principled design (a simple microprocessor), \n",
    "- learn to systematically debug increasingly complex systems, \n",
    "- hopefully be prepared to develop novel, out-of-the-box designs.\n",
    "The focus is on basics, principles, precedents, and how to use them to create/implement good designs.\n",
    "Content\tThe class consists of the following major blocks of contents:\n",
    "- Major Current Issues in Computer Architecture: Principles, Mysteries, Motivational Case Studies and Examples\n",
    "- Digital Logic Design: Combinational Logic, Sequential Logic, Hardware Description Languages, FPGAs, Timing and Verification.\n",
    "- Basics of Computer Architecture: Von Neumann Model of Computing, Instruction Set Architecture, Assembly Programming, Microarchitecture, Microprogramming.\n",
    "- Basics of Processor Design: Pipelining, Out-of-Order Execution, Branch Prediction.\n",
    "- Execution Paradigms: Out-of-order Execution, Dataflow, Superscalar Execution, VLIW, SIMD Processors, GPUs, Systolic Arrays, Multithreading.\n",
    "- Memory System: Memory Organization, Memory Technologies, Memory Hierarchy, Caches, Virtual Memory.\n",
