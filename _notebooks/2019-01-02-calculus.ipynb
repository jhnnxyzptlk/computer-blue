    "\n",
    "Calculus, sometimes known as infinitesimal calculus in its early days, is a mathematical subject that focuses on limits, continuity, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: [History of Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calculus)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two central ideas when dealing with calculus,  differential calculus and integral calculus. The former is concerned with instantaneous rates of change and curve slopes, whereas integral calculus is concerned with quantity accumulation and areas under or between curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Differential calculus can be thought of as a process of infinitely fine subtraction that is used to measure the differences between its parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Integral Calculus can be thought of as the process of infinitely fine additions, which integrates the parts back into the original whole. \n",

    "## Limits and Continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "> What does it mean to be continous\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experience in our daily lives appears to be continuous. That is, there are no abrupt changes or discontinuities in what we perceive and experience. That's great news. Imagine you're out for a beautiful walk when all of a sudden a split second disappears from the cosmos. That would be disastrous and unexpected for our experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: No change in nature can ever take place “by a leap\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Does continuity imply infinity? Well if we imagine a number line we assume there is an infinite number of numbers. That is there is a number in every posible position on the number line, its therefore smooth and continous. Yet within the infinite there seems to be discrete amount of numbers, such as the integers. What gives? \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: I will write more on the `Principal of Continuity` in a future blog post. \n",
    "\n",
    "A rigorous definition of continuity of real functions is usually given in a first course in calculus in terms of the idea of a limit. In mathematics, many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the page. Such functions are called continuous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all functions are continuous. Sometimes we cant figure out what a function is doing directly at a point. We can however see what it should be as we get closer to a limiting value. \n",
