The accumulation of knowledge is a continous process. It's difficult to gauge the point that I should stop and write down all that I know.
Whats worse, my ignorance increases with the number of questions I have. If you ever find yourself in my situation, start earlier. 

Do mind the cowebs on this digital journal. For I much rather have an intimate relationship between the pen, paper, Mind and God.
